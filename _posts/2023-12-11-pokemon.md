## Primer

Pokemon is a popular worldwide media franchise, featuring a variety of creatures with different abilities and powers that live alongside humans. The franchise includes video games, animated series, and a trading card game as its main forms of media.

However, Ruby and Sapphire have some exclusives that are not in Emerald and the remakes of the first generation games: Fire Red and Leaf Green also had older pokemon needed to complete the Pokedex. This meant in order to obtain all 386 Pokemon, you would need to go to multiple events that had already passed or get lucky and know someone with some of them as well as own all 5 games in generation 3. In addition to this, some event pokemon were only available in Japan on Japanese Pokemon Emerald cartridges. This meant I also had to obtain a Japanese version of Emerald to get a legit Jirachi event.
