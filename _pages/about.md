Hello! My name is Bryant Duong. I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Optum](https://www.optum.com/), a part of UnitedHealth Group. Previously, I interned as a summer research intern in 2023 at the National Institutes of Health doing bioinformatics [research](https://bryantduong.github.io/projects/3_project/) in Dr. Zhiyong Lu's lab. I also previously worked at the National Security Agency as a [Stokes Scholar](https://federaljobs.net/blog/the-stokes-educational-scholarship-program-nsa/) in 2015-2017.

In my spare time, I love to mentor/tutor junior engineers and students inside and outside of my company, as well as read sci-fi novels. To date, I have mentored over 30 engineers and interns in total on various topics, ranging from best software engineering practices to how to make the most out of a 1:1 meeting with your manager.

I also am currently a Master's student at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) studying [Computer and Information Technology](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/degrees/mcit-online/). The MCIT program allows me, an engineer with a nontraditional educational background, to study a combination of undergraduate Computer Science alongside graduate-level electives. Before Penn, I completed an MBA at the [UC Davis](https://gsm.ucdavis.edu/) and a BA in Cognitive Science at [UC Berkeley](https://cogsci.berkeley.edu/).

Currently, I an interested in learning more about projects that involve healthcare and bioinformatics.
