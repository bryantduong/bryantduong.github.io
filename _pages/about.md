Hi! I'm Bryant Duong, a software engineer at [Optum](https://www.optum.com/) and a research assistant in the Auslander Lab at the Wistar Institute. I'm also a Master's student in Computer and Information Technology at the University of Pennsylvania.

I hold an MBA from UC Davis and a BA in Cognitive Science from Berkeley. In summer 2023, I interned at the National Institutes of Health, conducting bioinformatics research in Dr. Zhiyong Lu's lab. Between 2015 and 2017, I was a [Stokes Scholar](https://federaljobs.net/blog/the-stokes-educational-scholarship-program-nsa/) at the National Security Agency.

Currently, I'm interested in healthcare and bioinformatics research. Outside of work, I mentor junior engineers and students, and also enjoy reading sci-fi novels and collecting anime cels/sketches.
