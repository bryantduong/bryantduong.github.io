Hi! I'm Bryant Duong, a Software Engineering Manager at [Optum](https://www.optum.com/) and a research assistant in the [Auslander Lab](https://wistar.org/our-scientists/noam-auslander) at the Wistar Institute. I'm also a Master's student in [Computer and Information Technology](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/degrees/mcit-online/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/).

I hold an MBA from [UC Davis](https://gsm.ucdavis.edu/) and a BA in Cognitive Science from [Berkeley](https://cogsci.berkeley.edu/). In summer 2023, I interned at the National Institutes of Health, conducting bioinformatics [research](https://bryantduong.github.io/projects/3_project/) in Dr. Zhiyong Lu's lab. Between 2015-2017, I was a [Stokes Scholar](https://federaljobs.net/blog/the-stokes-educational-scholarship-program-nsa/) at the National Security Agency.

Currently, I'm interested in healthcare and bioinformatics research. Outside of work, I mentor junior engineers and students, and enjoy reading sci-fi novels and collecting anime cels/sketches.
