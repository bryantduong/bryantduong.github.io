Hi! I'm Bryant Duong, an incoming Genomics & Computational Biology PhD student at Penn.  

I was previously a research assistant in Noam Auslander's Lab at the Wistar Institute in 2024/2025 and a software engineer for 6.5 years at Optum working on production CI/CD pipelines and EHR/insurance claims databases. In summer 2023, I interned at the National Institutes of Health, conducting bioinformatics research in Dr. Zhiyong Lu's lab. Between 2015 and 2017, I was a [Stokes Scholar](https://federaljobs.net/blog/the-stokes-educational-scholarship-program-nsa/) at the National Security Agency.

I received a Master's in Computer & Information Technology from Penn, MBA from UC Davis, and a BA in Cognitive Science from Berkeley.  Outside of work, I mentor junior engineers/college students looking to make a career transition into tech/academia and collect anime production cels.
