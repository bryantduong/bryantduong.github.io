Hi there! I'm Bryant Duong, a Senior Software Engineer at [Optum](https://www.optum.com/) and a lab assistant working in the [Auslander Lab](https://wistar.org/our-scientists/noam-auslander) at the Wistar Institute.

I'm also a Master's student studying [Computer and Information Technology](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/degrees/mcit-online/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). My academic journey also includes an MBA from [UC Davis](https://gsm.ucdavis.edu/) and a BA in Cognitive Science from [Berkeley](https://cogsci.berkeley.edu/).

In summer 2023, I interned at the National Institutes of Health, conducting bioinformatics [research](https://bryantduong.github.io/projects/3_project/) in Dr. Zhiyong Lu's lab. Between 2015-2017, I worked at the National Security Agency as a [Stokes Scholar](https://federaljobs.net/blog/the-stokes-educational-scholarship-program-nsa/). I'm currently interested in exploring more research projects in healthcare and bioinformatics.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about mentoring. I've guided over 30 junior engineers and students, both within and outside my company, on a range of topicsâ€”from software engineering best practices to optimizing 1:1 manager meetings. Reading sci-fi novels and collecting anime cels/sketches that led to animation production are some of the hobbies I enjoy.
