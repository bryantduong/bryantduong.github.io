Hi! I'm Bryant Duong, an incoming Genomics & Computational Biology PhD student at Penn. Currently, I am a research assistant in Noam Auslander's Lab at the Wistar Institute.

I hold an MBA from UC Davis, a Master's in Computer & Information Technology from Penn, and a BA in Cognitive Science from Berkeley. 

I've been a software engineer for 6.5 years at Optum working on production CI/CD pipelines, DevOps transparency, and full stack EHR data visualization applications. In summer 2023, I interned at the National Institutes of Health, conducting bioinformatics research in Dr. Zhiyong Lu's lab. Between 2015 and 2017, I was a [Stokes Scholar](https://federaljobs.net/blog/the-stokes-educational-scholarship-program-nsa/) at the National Security Agency.

Currently, I'm interested in healthcare and bioinformatics research. Outside of work, I mentor junior engineers (80% retention rate at Optum) and students at the high school and undergraduate level. In my spare time, I also enjoy reading sci-fi novels and collecting anime cels/sketches.
