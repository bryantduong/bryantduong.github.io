Hi there! I'm Bryant Duong, a Senior Software Engineer at [Optum](https://www.optum.com/), part of UnitedHealth Group. In summer 2023, I interned at the National Institutes of Health, conducting bioinformatics [research](https://bryantduong.github.io/projects/3_project/) in Dr. Zhiyong Lu's lab. Between 2015-2017, I worked at the National Security Agency as a [Stokes Scholar](https://federaljobs.net/blog/the-stokes-educational-scholarship-program-nsa/). I'm currently interested in exploring more research projects in healthcare and bioinformatics.

I'm also pursuing a Master's in [Computer and Information Technology](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/degrees/mcit-online/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). The MCIT program, tailored for individuals with unique educational backgrounds like mine, blends undergraduate Computer Science with graduate-level courses. My academic journey also includes an MBA from [UC Davis](https://gsm.ucdavis.edu/) and a BA in Cognitive Science from [UC Berkeley](https://cogsci.berkeley.edu/).

Outside of work, I'm passionate about mentoring. I've guided over 30 junior engineers and students, both within and outside my company, on a range of topicsâ€”from software engineering best practices to optimizing 1:1 manager meetings. Reading sci-fi novels and collecting anime cels/sketches that led to animation production are other pastimes I cherish.
