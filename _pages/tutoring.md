## Qualifications

As a PhD student at Penn, I offer tutoring online via meeting software of choice, with a focus on providing the highest level of service. A long term relationship is built on trust and open communication; I respond to most emails/texts within 6 hours.

My students call on me for assistance on a wide variety of undergraduate to graduate Math/CS classes, as well as SAT and AP Calculus prep. If you are looking for help with exam prep and/or homework assignments, please do not hesitate to reach out. 

As a background, I have been assisting/tutoring students for the past decade and scored the 99th percentile in the SAT and 770/800 on the SAT Math II Subject Test and a 720/800 on the Chemistry SAT Subject test. I have tutored/assisted many undergraduates and high school level students since 2017. I earned a BA in Cognitive Science at Berkeley with a Regents Scholarship, MBA at UC Davis, and Masters in CS at Penn. I have also commented and revised Personal Statements and admissions applications since 2018 for students applying to STEM graduate and undergraduate programs/universities as well as assisted in selecting a shortlist of schools to apply to.

My students regularly see admissions to the top 25-50 universities. Some examples include Penn, UC Irvine, and various start ups. Please see testimonials below.

## Lesson Schedule

Lessons will be scheduled with client with the following rules:

* Same-day cancellations, reschedulings, or no-shows by the student or by their parent/guardian without an excusable exception will incur a fee of 50% of the scheduled session. There is no penalty for cancelling or rescheduling the day before a session or earlier. However, if a student cancels or reschedules too often, we will need to discuss this issue on a case-by-case basis. This policy also applies in reverse. If I have to same day cancel or reschedule, your session is half off.
* Slight delays in joining the session are okay, but do not make it a recurring event.
* Notifications for cancellations or reschedulings may be sent via email.
